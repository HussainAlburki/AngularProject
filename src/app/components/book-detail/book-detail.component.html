        <p class="book-summary">Dune is set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various
            noble houses control planetary fiefs. It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the
            stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert
            wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or "spice", a drug that extends life and enhances mental
            abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional
            awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of
            the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of
            politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each
            other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.</p>
